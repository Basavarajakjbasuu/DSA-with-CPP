/*
üîç Explanation:
- The `Graph` class uses an unordered_map to store adjacency lists, where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
- The `addEdges` function handles both directed and undirected edges based on the `direction` parameter.
- The `printAdjList` function prints the adjacency list, showing the graph structure after each edge addition.

‚è≥ Time Complexity:
- Adding an edge: O(1)
- Printing the adjacency list: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

üíæ Space Complexity:
- O(V + E) for storing the adjacency list.

üìä Example Output:
After each edge addition, the adjacency list will be printed:
Printing adjacency list after adding edge (0, 1)
0 -> { 1, }

Printing adjacency list after adding edge (1, 2)
0 -> { 1, }
1 -> { 2, }

Printing adjacency list after adding edge (1, 3)
0 -> { 1, }
1 -> { 2, 3, }

Printing adjacency list after adding edge (3, 2)
0 -> { 1, }
1 -> { 2, 3, }
3 -> { 2, }
