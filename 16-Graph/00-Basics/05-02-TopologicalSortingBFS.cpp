📋 Sample Output:

0 -> { 1, }
1 -> { 2, }
2 -> { 3, }
3 -> { 4, 5, }
4 -> { 5, }
5 -> { 6, }
6 -> { 7, }
7 -> { }
Topological Sorting: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

Explanation:
1️⃣ The graph has nodes 0 to 7. Topological order ensures that every directed edge u -> v implies that u comes before v in the order.
2️⃣ Here, node 0 starts the topological order as it has no incoming edges (in-degree is 0).
3️⃣ The algorithm proceeds to process the next node based on in-degree, ensuring the topological order constraints.

⏳ Time Complexity (TC):
- O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- Each node and its adjacent edges are processed exactly once.

🗂 Space Complexity (SC):
- O(V), where V is the number of vertices. The space is used for the in-degree map and the queue.
