üîç Explanation:
- The `Graph` class uses an unordered_map to store adjacency lists, where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
- The `addEdges` function handles both directed and undirected edges based on the `isDirected` parameter.
- The `WeightedGraph` class stores edges as pairs of nodes with weights, with similar logic to the `Graph` class.
- The `printAdjacencyList` and `printGraph` functions print the adjacency lists for both graph types.

‚è≥ Time Complexity:
- Adding an edge: O(1)
- Printing the adjacency list: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

üíæ Space Complexity:
- O(V + E) for storing the adjacency list.

üìä Example Output:
 For Integer weighted Graph:

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (0, 1) with weight 5
0: {{1, 5}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (1, 2) with weight 10
0: {{1, 5}, }
1: {{2, 10}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (1, 3) with weight 15
0: {{1, 5}, }
1: {{2, 10}, {3, 15}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (3, 1) with weight 17
0: {{1, 5}, }
1: {{2, 10}, {3, 15}, }
3: {{1, 17}, }

OUTPUT: Character weighted Graph:

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (a,b) with weight 2
a: {{b,2}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (b,c) with weight 4
b: {{c,4}, }
a: {{b,2}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (b,d) with weight 8
b: {{c,4}, {d,8}, }
a: {{b,2}, }

Printing weighted adjacency list after adding edge (d,a) with weight 10
d: {{a,10}, }
b: {{c,4}, {d,8}, }
a: {{b,2}, }

- The weighted graph shows edges between nodes along with their respective weights.
