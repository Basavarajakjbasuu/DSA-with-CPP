# 📚 DSA Master Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Master Repository**! This repository is designed to cover **all essential concepts and problems** in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Whether you're preparing for interviews, coding competitions, or simply want to strengthen your DSA skills, this is the perfect place to start!

## 🎯 Goals

- Master key **data structures** and their implementations.
- Solve a variety of **algorithmic problems** with real-world applications.
- Understand **time and space complexities** for each approach.
- Practice **optimized solutions** for competitive programming.

## 🛠️ Structure

Each concept is organized in its own folder with:
1. **Explanation** of the concept.
2. **Code implementation** in C++, Python, or Java.
3. **Solved questions** with explanations and time/space complexities.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the **DSA community** and online platforms for providing amazing resources for learning and practicing!
